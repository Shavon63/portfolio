        <h1>Motivations</h1>
        <p class sparagraph>After years of being an entrepreneur and owning my own detailing business , I decided to pivot and getting into a career where I can be more of a major force on human impact. IT has been a major driving force in the improvement in so much industries, making things more efficient from all standpoints of those participating either it be a cancer patient or a doctor or a car salesman and a potential buyer.Owning my own detailing business I was able to positively affect up to 1000 clients a year which came with teaching me how to walk people into helping me solve their own problems with the upmost satisfaction. I can imagine if I was was able to use those same skill with my software development/web development skillset to help companies impact peoples lives would be more fulfilling. I saw the way technolgies were interacting and shifting the human colective conscienceness and decided thats the lane i would step into with hopes of cutting out a small space for myself. I'm glad i could give a brief look into my mindset. If i fit what your company is looking for then feel free to contact me & i will be sure to get back to you.</p>
