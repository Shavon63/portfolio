             <p class="paragraph">I love cars and the almost engineering wichtcraft like developments that has turned them into the aesthetically pleasing machines today.I own my own detains business but I've decided though to pivot into a career where I can be more of a force on human impact. "IT" has been a major driving force in improving countless industries and making things more efficient from all standpoints of those participating. It could be a cancer patient or a doctor or a car salesman and a potential buyer.Owning my own detailing business I was able to positively affect up to 1000 clients a year which came with teaching me great customer service skills. I also picked up helping people in their realm of circumstances while being profitable. I can imagine if I was was able to use those same skill with my software development skillset to help companies impact peoples lives which would be more fulfilling. I see the way technologies are interacting and shifting the human collective conscienceless and decided, this would be the lane i could spend my time and energy with the hopes of cutting out a small space for myself. I'm glad I could give a brief look into my mindset & life. If i fit what your company is looking for then feel free to contact me & i will be sure to get back to you.</p>
