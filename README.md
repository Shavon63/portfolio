#### Technologies used 
I used css and html with Javascript. in java there was a neccessity to make buttons to change the pages of my portfolio. it was also neccessary to download other fonts from google to be added to the portfolio. also i used a animation technology in the css to make the words of my fonts flicker.

##### installation instructions 
first I had to add my css file name to the html with rel=stylesheet and href=style.css. i then had to hook up my java by adding scripts tags and adding app.js to its src.

#### hurdles i faced
i think my major problem is implementing beautiful design into my program. another problem i faced is detachting the H1s from the nav buttons. for some reason everywhere i tryied moving the headings vertically, the nav would follow.
